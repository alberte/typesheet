# typesheet

typesheet is a tiny Python script for creating transparent PNG spritesheets from TrueType (.ttf) fonts.

I made it because I couldn't find an easy option online while developing a game.

I welcome contributions, but I don't plan to spend more than a few minutes a month maintaining this repo.

an example image. switch to dark mode if you can't see it.

## How to use

### 1. Install
`pip install pillow tcod numpy PIL`

There might be more dependencies missing. If so, you should install them the same way.  I'll accept PRs to update the list of deps, but I rarely write Python and can't be bothered to set up a clean-room environment to figure them out myself.

### 2. Use
See the usage string:
```
$ ./make_tileset.py -h
$ python3 make_tileset.py -h                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        126 â†µ
